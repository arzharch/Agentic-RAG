QUERY:
are the risks identified in our risk assessment actually manifesting into our day-to-day operations and customer experience

============================================================
REASONING PROCESS:
============================================================
1.  **Identify all risks:** I first extracted all identified risks, their levels, probabilities, and impacts from `risk_assessment_q1.txt`. These are:
    *   Security Vulnerability Exposure (HIGH)
    *   Database Performance Degradation (MEDIUM)
    *   Customer Churn Due to Issues (MEDIUM)
    *   Third-Party API Reliability (HIGH)
    *   Key Personnel Dependency (HIGH)
    *   Budget Overrun on Infrastructure (MEDIUM)

2.  **Cross-reference each risk with operational and customer data:** For each identified risk, I systematically searched the other provided documents (`performance_metrics_jan.txt`, `customer_feedback_dec.txt`, `deployment_log_recent.txt`, `technical_debt_analysis.txt`) for any mentions, incidents, alerts, or customer feedback that would indicate the risk is manifesting.

3.  **Synthesize and infer:**
    *   **Database Performance Degradation:** Multiple sources directly confirm this. `performance_metrics_jan.txt` shows alerts, `customer_feedback_dec.txt` shows complaints about slow search, `deployment_log_recent.txt` details a failed deployment related to search/database, and `technical_debt_analysis.txt` lists it as high-priority technical debt. This is a strong manifestation.
    *   **Customer Churn Due to Issues:** The `risk_assessment_q1.txt` itself mentions NPS drop. `customer_feedback_dec.txt` directly corroborates this with a further drop in overall satisfaction and NPS, linking it to specific performance and API issues. This is a clear manifestation.
    *   **Third-Party API Reliability:** `customer_feedback_dec.txt` contains specific complaints about payment processing (Stripe) and email notifications (SendGrid), and a broader API integration issue, directly aligning with this risk. This is a clear manifestation.
    *   **Security Vulnerability Exposure:** While no data breach is reported, `technical_debt_analysis.txt` confirms the "Legacy Authentication System" as critical technical debt with "Security vulnerability," indicating the underlying condition for the risk is present and active.
    *   **Key Personnel Dependency:** No evidence in any other document supports the manifestation of this risk beyond its identification in the risk assessment.
    *   **Budget Overrun on Infrastructure:** The `risk_assessment_q1.txt` states the overrun, but no other document (like a budget report) provides independent confirmation of this actual manifestation.

4.  **Formulate the answer:** Based on the synthesis, I constructed a comprehensive answer, detailing each risk, its assessment, and the specific evidence of its manifestation (or lack thereof), citing all sources.

============================================================
FINAL ANSWER:
============================================================
Yes, several risks identified in the Q1 2024 risk assessment are actively manifesting in day-to-day operations and customer experience.

Here's a breakdown of the identified risks and their current manifestations:

1.  **Database Performance Degradation** (Risk Level: MEDIUM, Probability: 80%, Impact: Medium - from `risk_assessment_q1.txt`)
    *   **Manifestation:** This risk is clearly and significantly manifesting, impacting both operations and customer experience.
        *   Operational metrics show "High response time alerts: 23 times" and "Database connection pool exhaustion: 5 times" in January (from `performance_metrics_jan.txt`).
        *   Customer feedback highlights "Search functionality is still very slow, especially with large datasets" as a critical complaint affecting 67% of enterprise customers, leading to "HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES: 1. Search performance optimization" (from `customer_feedback_dec.txt`).
        *   A recent deployment on January 12, 2024, involving "New search algorithm implementation" and "Database index optimizations," resulted in a partial rollback due to "Search functionality 10x slower than expected" and "High CPU usage causing timeout errors" (from `deployment_log_recent.txt`).
        *   "Database Query Performance" is identified as a high-priority technical debt, causing "customer-facing performance issues" with "Search queries taking 8-12 seconds with large datasets" (from `technical_debt_analysis.txt`).

2.  **Customer Churn Due to Issues** (Risk Level: MEDIUM, Probability: 50%, Impact: High - from `risk_assessment_q1.txt`)
    *   **Manifestation:** This risk is actively manifesting through declining customer satisfaction.
        *   The risk assessment itself notes "Recent performance issues and bugs causing customer dissatisfaction (NPS dropped to 42)" (from `risk_assessment_q1.txt`).
        *   Customer feedback data corroborates this, reporting "Overall satisfaction: 3.7/5 (down from 4.1 in November)" and a "Net Promoter Score: 42 (down from 58)" (from `customer_feedback_dec.txt`). The complaints about slow search, payment failures, and API integration issues directly contribute to this dissatisfaction.

3.  **Third-Party API Reliability** (Risk Level: HIGH, Probability: 40%, Impact: High - from `risk_assessment_q1.txt`)
    *   **Manifestation:** Issues related to third-party API reliability are impacting customers.
        *   Customer feedback includes complaints such as "Payment processing failed twice this month, very frustrating" (URGENT), which relates to the dependency on the Stripe API mentioned in the risk assessment (from `customer_feedback_dec.txt`).
        *   Another complaint, "Email notifications are inconsistent, sometimes I don't get them at all," points to issues with the SendGrid email system (from `customer_feedback_dec.txt`).
        *   A critical complaint, "The new update broke our API integration, cost us 2 days of downtime," indicates broader API stability concerns impacting B2B customers (from `customer_feedback_dec.txt`).

4.  **Security Vulnerability Exposure** (Risk Level: HIGH, Probability: 70%, Impact: Critical - from `risk_assessment_q1.txt`)
    *   **Manifestation:** The underlying vulnerability is confirmed to exist as a critical technical debt, though a data breach has not been reported in the provided logs.
        *   The risk assessment describes this as a "Legacy authentication system has known vulnerabilities. Potential for data breach" (from `risk_assessment_q1.txt`).
        *   "Legacy Authentication System" is listed as "CRITICAL technical debt" with "Impact: Security vulnerability, blocking new integrations" and "uses deprecated libraries with known vulnerabilities" (from `technical_debt_analysis.txt`).

5.  **Key Personnel Dependency** (Risk Level: HIGH, Probability: 60%, Impact: Critical - from `risk_assessment_q1.txt`)
    *   **Manifestation:** The risk is identified, but there is no direct evidence in the provided documents of an incident or operational impact specifically caused by Mike's single point of failure.

6.  **Budget Overrun on Infrastructure** (Risk Level: MEDIUM, Probability: 30%, Impact: Medium - from `risk_assessment_q1.txt`)
    *   **Manifestation:** The `risk_assessment_q1.txt` states "Cloud costs growing 15% faster than projected due to inefficient API usage." However, no further corroborating evidence from other files (e.g., a budget report or financial statement) is available to confirm the actual manifestation of this overrun beyond its initial identification in the risk assessment.

In conclusion, the risks related to **Database Performance Degradation**, **Customer Churn Due to Issues**, and **Third-Party API Reliability** are clearly manifesting and directly impacting day-to-day operations and customer experience. The **Security Vulnerability Exposure** is an active technical debt, confirming the presence of the vulnerability. The manifestation of **Key Personnel Dependency** and **Budget Overrun** is not explicitly detailed in the provided operational or customer feedback data beyond their initial identification in the risk assessment.
