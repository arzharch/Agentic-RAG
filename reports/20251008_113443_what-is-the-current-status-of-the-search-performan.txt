QUERY:
what is the current status of the search performance issue

============================================================
REASONING PROCESS:
============================================================
1.  **Identify the core issue and its history:** The `customer_feedback_dec.txt` indicates search performance was already "very slow, especially with large datasets" in December. The `technical_debt_analysis.txt` corroborates this, identifying "Database Query Performance" (N+1 query problems, 8-12 second queries) as a high-priority technical debt item. This establishes a pre-existing, underlying problem.
2.  **Pinpoint the recent exacerbation:** The `deployment_log_recent.txt` clearly states that a new search algorithm (v2.1.3) deployed on January 12, 2024, caused the search functionality to become "10x slower than expected," leading to high CPU usage and timeout errors. This deployment was subsequently rolled back. This marks a significant recent worsening of the issue.
3.  **Gather current performance metrics:** The `performance_metrics_jan.txt` provides up-to-date metrics. The `/api/search` endpoint has a critical average response time of 12.4 seconds. Overall application response time is 2.3 seconds (target <1.5s), with 95th percentile at 8.2 seconds and 99th percentile at 15.7 seconds. The error rate has increased to 3.2% (from 1.8% in December). These metrics likely reflect the state *after* the v2.1.3 rollback, indicating that even with the rollback, performance remains severely degraded, possibly due to the underlying issues or lingering effects.
4.  **Assess impact:** `customer_feedback_dec.txt` states 67% of enterprise customers are affected. `performance_metrics_jan.txt` shows an 8% decrease in Daily Active Users (DAU) and an increase in bounce rate to 34% (from 28%). The system has also triggered numerous alerts (23 high response time, 12 error rate spike) (from `performance_metrics_jan.txt`).
5.  **Detail resolution efforts and root cause:**
    *   **Immediate action:** The v2.1.3 deployment was rolled back on January 12, 2024 (from `deployment_log_recent.txt`).
    *   **Ongoing investigation:** The team is "investigating root cause" for the issues introduced by v2.1.3 (from `deployment_log_recent.txt`).
    *   **Recommendations/Planned actions:** `performance_metrics_jan.txt` recommends "Immediate search endpoint optimization required" and "database query caching."
    *   **Addressing underlying issues:** The "Database Query Performance" technical debt, identified in `technical_debt_analysis.txt`, is being addressed by Mike Chen with an estimated effort of 2 weeks. This directly tackles the N+1 query problems.
6.  **Identify responsible parties and timelines:** Mike Chen is responsible for the database query performance technical debt with a 2-week estimated effort (from `technical_debt_analysis.txt`). An overall timeline for the full resolution of the search performance issue, especially concerning the recent v2.1.3 impact, is not explicitly provided beyond "ongoing investigation."
7.  **Synthesize and structure:** Combine all gathered information into a coherent narrative, addressing each point from the `Query Analysis` and citing sources. Ensure specific numbers and dates are included.

FINAL ANSWER:
============================================================
The current status of the search performance issue is critical, stemming from both long-standing underlying problems and a recent exacerbation due to a faulty deployment.

**Description of the Issue:**
The search functionality has been experiencing significant performance degradation. Customer feedback from December already highlighted that "Search functionality is still very slow, especially with large datasets" (from customer_feedback_dec.txt). A technical debt analysis identified "Database Query Performance" as a high-priority issue, noting search queries taking 8-12 seconds with large datasets due to N+1 query problems (from technical_debt_analysis.txt).

This pre-existing issue was severely worsened on January 12, 2024, when a new search algorithm implementation (v2.1.3) caused the search functionality to become "10x slower than expected" and led to high CPU usage and timeout errors (from deployment_log_recent.txt). Although this deployment was rolled back, current performance metrics from January show the `/api/search` endpoint has a critical average response time of 12.4 seconds. The overall average application response time is 2.3 seconds (target: <1.5s), with the 95th percentile at 8.2 seconds and the 99th percentile at 15.7 seconds. The error rate has also increased to 3.2% (from 1.8% in December) (from performance_metrics_jan.txt).

**Current State of Resolution Efforts:**
The new search algorithm implemented in v2.1.3 was rolled back on January 12, 2024. The team is currently "investigating root cause" for the issues it introduced (from deployment_log_recent.txt).
In parallel, recommendations include "Immediate search endpoint optimization required" and implementing "database query caching" (from performance_metrics_jan.txt). The "Database Query Performance" technical debt item, which addresses the N+1 query problems, is being actively addressed.

**Impact Assessment:**
The issue is critical, affecting 67% of enterprise customers (from customer_feedback_dec.txt). The performance degradation has led to an 8% decrease in Daily Active Users (DAU) from December, and the bounce rate has increased to 34% (from 28%) (from performance_metrics_jan.txt). The system has triggered numerous alerts, including 23 high response time alerts and 12 error rate spike alerts (from performance_metrics_jan.txt).

**Responsible Team/Individuals & Timeline:**
Mike Chen is the Lead Engineer responsible for addressing the "Database Query Performance" technical debt, with an estimated effort of 2 weeks for that specific component (from technical_debt_analysis.txt). An overall resolution timeline for the entire search performance issue, particularly concerning the ongoing investigation into the recent algorithm rollback, has not been explicitly provided.
